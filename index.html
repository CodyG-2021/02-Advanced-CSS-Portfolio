        <p>
          Hobbyist, graphic design dabbler, code learner, cat lover.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Born and raised in Colorado and spun around the sun 30 times, I've found passion in fantasy and all that it creates. I have a degree in graphic design and computer graphics from the University of Northern Colorado.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I Currently work for PramsPlus as a support specialist for many oil and gas companies that use our production program. With lots of patience I hope to learn a skill I have never fully been able to grasp, coding. With this knowledge I hope to be able to improve myself in my job and one day launch Prams via the web.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I enjoy a game of magic whenever I can get it and in my spare time I've picked up tabletop wargaming. I like to paint models and find it very satisfying to see all the work that slowly progresses on them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read about me.I hope you enjoy looking at my work and projects soon to come!
          ~ Cody
